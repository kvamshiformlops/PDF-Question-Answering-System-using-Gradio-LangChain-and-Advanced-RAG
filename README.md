# PDF Question-Answering System using Gradio, LangChain, and Advanced RAG

This application enables users to upload PDF files, process them, and then ask questions based on the content of the documents. By leveraging advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the system intelligently retrieves relevant content from the PDF files and generates highly contextual answers. This setup uses Gradio for an intuitive interface, making it easy for users to upload, process, and interact with the documents.

## Overview
This project utilizes LangChain, FAISS, and HuggingFace embeddings to build a powerful vector store. By using advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the system combines retrieval and generation techniques, ensuring answers are accurate and contextually relevant to the documents.

## Features
- **PDF Upload and Processing**: Upload multiple PDF files, extract and sanitize text content, and split it into manageable chunks.
- **Advanced RAG-based Question Answering**: Leverages RAG techniques to perform efficient retrieval and provide context-aware answers directly from the document content.
- **Conversational Chain**: Uses LangChain's prompt-based question-answering with the Ollama model for natural, detailed responses.


## How It Works
1. **PDF Processing**:
   - PDF files are uploaded and read page by page.
   - Text is sanitized and split into chunks using LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
   - Chunks are stored in a vector database (FAISS) using embeddings generated by HuggingFace's `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.

2. **Advanced RAG Question Answering**:
   - RAG uses retrieved text chunks and generates highly accurate responses based on the query context.
   - The userâ€™s question is matched with relevant document chunks via similarity search.
   - Based on the retrieved documents, a LangChain conversational chain, enhanced with RAG, delivers a precise answer.

## Usage
### Processing PDFs
1. Upload multiple PDFs via the "Process PDFs" tab.
2. Click **Process** to start the analysis. Once completed, a message will confirm the process.

### Asking Questions
1. Switch to the "Ask Questions" tab.
2. Enter a question based on the PDF contents and submit it to receive a response.

## Dependencies
- **Gradio**: For building the interactive interface.
- **LangChain**: For handling the question-answering logic.
- **PyPDF2**: For reading and extracting text from PDF files.
- **HuggingFace Transformers**: For text embeddings.
- **FAISS**: For vector storage and similarity search.
- **Advanced RAG**: For enhanced context retrieval and answer generation.
